        Question 01: What is difference between Local Storage and sesson storage 
       </h2>  
       <h3>
          Ans: sessionStorage is almost similar to localStorage but the difference is that:<br>
          while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.<br> 
          Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

        Question 02: What is differences Between Local Scope and Global Scope Variable In JavaScript
       </h2>  
       <h3>
          Ans: There are two types of scope in JavaScript.<br>
          These are:Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.<br>
          Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.

        Question 03: How does the event loop work in Javascript 
       </h2>  
       <h3>
          Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job — <br>
          to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
